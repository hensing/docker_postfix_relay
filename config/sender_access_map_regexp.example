# This is an example file for Postfix's sender login mapping.
# It defines which authenticated users are allowed to send email from which "From" addresses.
#
# Format: /<regex_pattern_for_from_address>/ <space_separated_list_of_allowed_users>
#
# - This file uses regular expressions.
# - Lines starting with # are comments.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# This file can contain sensitive information about your user structure.
# It is recommended to add the actual file to your .gitignore.

# Example 1: Allow any authenticated user to send as themselves.
# The SASL username must match the local part of the email address.
# e.g., user 'webapp' can send as 'webapp@yourdomain.com'.
/^([^@]+)@yourdomain\.com$/   $1

# Example 2: Allow specific users ('user1', 'user2') to send from a shared address.
/^shared-address@yourdomain\.com$/   user1,user2

# Example 3: Allow a group of users to send from any "no-reply" address.
/^no-reply-([^@]+)@yourdomain\.com$/   user1,user3,webapp
