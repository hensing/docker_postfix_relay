# This is an example file for Postfix SMTP client authentication.
# It stores the credentials needed to send email via a relay host (e.g., Gmail).
#
# Format: [relayhost]:port username:password
#
# - [relayhost]:port must exactly match the 'relayhost' parameter in main.cf.
#   The square brackets are important as they prevent MX record lookups.
# - username:password are the credentials for the relay service.
#   For Gmail, this would be your full email address and an App Password.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# This file contains sensitive information and should be protected (chmod 600).
# It should be listed in your .gitignore file.
# After editing this file, you must run 'postmap' on it to create the .db file,
# however, the entrypoint.sh script handles this automatically on container start.
